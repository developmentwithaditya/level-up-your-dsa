    Why to solve pattern -
                            Because it make you more flexible to think & solve a DSA problem. So it recommed to solve some pattern print problem before learning DSA.
    Steps to solve a pattern problem -
                                        1. A pattern problem is solve using nested loop.
                                        2. Outer loop is for rows & Inner loop is for columns of a pattern.
                                        3. Connect inner loop somehow to outer loop.
                                        4. Whatever you printing print inside inner loop.
                                        5. Observe symmetry (Optional).
